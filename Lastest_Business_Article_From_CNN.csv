2,‘Seismic shift.’ Kroger’s fight against a federal agency could upend antitrust,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/20/business/kroger-albertsons-ftc-lawsuit/index.html,"['Supermarket chain Kroger is suing a federal agency in a daring move that aims to weaken how Washington fights mergers that threaten to jack up prices on consumers.', 'The lawsuit alleges the Federal Trade Commission is violating the US Constitution by using an in-house tribunal to challenge Kroger’s $25 billion mega-merger with Albertsons — the biggest proposed supermarket deal in American history.', 'The FTC typically enforces antitrust in one of two ways: It can sue companies and take them to directly to court, or it can attempt to use its own in-house administrative law judges to issue a ruling or reach a settlement outside of court. In the case of Kroger, the FTC actually pursued both options, seeking to block the merger in court and make a ruling on it with its in-house administrators.', 'Companies can challenge the FTC’s administrative decisions in court. But Kroger claimed that tribunal process is unconstitutional.', 'The Kroger lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in Cincinnati, relies in part on a landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that further curbed the power of regulatory agencies. The new lawsuit represents a key test case and the latest effort to reshape the administrative state in America.', 'Experts say a Kroger victory would usher in a seismic shift in how the federal government challenges mergers. US officials fear that weakening regulators’ ability to fight monopolies could hurt consumers by giving corporations too much power to raise prices and close stores.', '“It’s huge. If they are successful and appellate courts agree, one of the primary arms for antitrust oversight is literally being cut off at the elbow,” said Christine Bartholomew, a professor of law at the University of Buffalo School of Law. “It would be a radical shift in the way we do antitrust in this country.”', 'Bartholomew said she’s “troubled” by the lawsuit because if the FTC is no longer able to use its own in-house tribunals, there would likely be less antitrust scrutiny of corporate mergers.', '“The risk is more deals, more concentration and potentially higher prices and less consumer choice,” she said.', 'In February, the FTC sued to block the $25 billion deal between Kroger and Albertsons that was announced in 2022. The agency argued the merger would lift prices, shut stores and wipe out jobs.', 'Kroger has argued the deal would do the exact opposite, helping the supermarket chains compete against non-union giants including Amazon, Costco and Walmart.', 'In a statement to CNN, Kroger said its “business model is built on a foundation of bringing customers lower prices and more choices.”', 'The company said it’s committed to investing $1 billion after the Albertsons merger closes to reduce prices for customers in stores across the country as well as $1.3 billion to enhance the customer experience. “Kroger has a proven track record of lowering prices in previous mergers,” the company said.', 'The FTC is challenging the Kroger deal on two fronts: in federal court and via an administrative trial.', 'Next week, Kroger faces the court in Portland, Oregon on the deal. The FTC has asked the judge in that case to temporarily block the Kroger-Albertsons deal while the in-house tribunal weighs the transaction.', 'In the new lawsuit, Kroger argues that the FTC “clearly violates the Constitution” in two ways: The administrative law judge is not removable by the President of the United States and the case is being fought in the executive branch instead of the courts.', 'Kroger cites the landmark Supreme Court decision in June where justices limited the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce rules with in-house reviews instead of jury trials.', '“We stand prepared to defend this merger in the upcoming trial in federal court — the appropriate venue for this matter to be heard,” Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a statement. “We are asking the Court to halt what amounts to an unlawful proceeding before the FTC’s own in-house tribunal.”', 'McMullen added that the merger between Kroger and Albertson’s is “squarely focused on ensuring we bring customers lower prices starting day one while securing the future of good-paying union jobs.”', 'The FTC declined to comment on the Kroger lawsuit.', 'A source familiar with the matter dismissed the Kroger lawsuit as a “desperate Hail Mary.”', 'The move comes as part of a broader effort by corporate America to push back on what some view as regulatory overreach.', 'Even some Democratic megadonors (ones with business interests at stake) have argued that the FTC’s efforts to fight monopolies have gone too far during the Biden administration.', 'The Supreme Court has recently ruled in favor of businesses fighting regulations, including overturning the Chevron Doctrine in its blockbuster June decision that weakens the ability of agencies to approve regulations.', '“The whole administrative structure is under legal attack right now,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust law professor at Vanderbilt Law School.', 'Allensworth said a Kroger victory would amount to a “seismic shift” in how the FTC and other federal agencies operate.', '“It would definitely take an arrow out of the quiver of the FTC,” she said.', 'Noting the recent series of Supreme Court decisions against federal agencies, Allensworth said a Kroger victory can’t be ruled out.', '“The law is whatever the Supreme Court says it is.

4,Minnesota’s economy is in the spotlight as Walz readies for the DNC,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/21/economy/tim-walz-minnesota-economy/index.html,"['When Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, the national spotlight fell on the North Star State.', 'Upper Midwest culture and cuisine turned into lighthearted talking points for the talking heads: the long-winded “Minnesota Goodbyes”; the duality of “Minnesota Nice”; and the prevalence of pop, tater tot hotdishes and Ju(i)cy Lucys (that’s soda, casseroles, and variantly spelled cheese-filled burgers for those who have yet to visit).', 'Heck, even Sweet Martha’s overflowing pail of cookies (a State Fair staple) got a shout-out on “The Daily Show.”', 'All the Minnesota niceties aside, Walz’s elevation means his state’s economic performance is now front and center in an election where the cost of living and the stability of the job market are getting heavy play.', 'Here’s a snapshot of the Minnesota economy and its future trajectory:', 'In 2023, the state’s real gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — increased just 1.2%, placing it 45th among all states (only Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Wisconsin and Delaware fared worse), Commerce Department data shows. The US grew at more than double Minnesota’s rate.', 'To kick off 2024, the situation wasn’t much better: Economic growth slowed across the US in the first quarter to 1.4%, and GDP growth turned negative in Minnesota by 0.8%.', 'Minnesota wasn’t alone in its contraction. Several surrounding states — including both Dakotas, Illinois and Iowa — also saw their economic growth turn negative.', '“Minnesota is interesting because a lot of its growth trends that you hear about are affected by larger regional aspects,” said Tyler Schipper, assistant professor of economics and data analysis at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. “It’s because of aging populations and less immigration, and (Midwest states) don’t have access to export markets on the coasts.”', 'The recent population change trends in Minnesota have less to do with deaths (they’ve been well outpaced by births from 2020 to 2023) and more to do with migration, specifically domestic migration, Schipper noted.', 'More Minnesota residents have left the state in recent years than people who came in from out of state, Census data shows. In 2022, Minnesota’s net domestic migration was -28,893. Only eight other states had deeper outflows.', 'The situation improved in 2023 as that net domestic loss narrowed in 2023 to -4,686.', 'In recent years, Minnesota — which since the early 1990s has been a significant community for Somalis (both refugees and non-refugees) — also has seen strong international immigration, which not only helped to blunt the domestic migration losses but also brought its overall net migration tally positive for last year.', '“Yes, people are moving out of Minnesota, but it’s not necessarily a mass exodus,” Schipper said.', 'Still, migration data could show how people are “voting with their feet,” said Christopher Phelan, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.', '“The companies leaving California aren’t moving to Minnesota, they’re moving to Florida or Texas,” he said. “When rich people are leaving other states, they’re not moving to Minnesota, they’re moving to Florida, Texas or Idaho.”', 'As to what’s potentially driving people away, the winters sure don’t do Minnesota any favors. But one of the biggest bogeymen blamed has been taxes.', 'At 9.8%, Minnesota has the highest corporate income tax rate among all states. It achieved that ranking at the start of this year after a surcharge expired in New Jersey, bringing the Garden State’s corporate tax rate down to 9%.', 'Minnesota’s 9.8% rate is not new, by any means. It’s been on the books for at least 15 years, long before Walz took office in 2019.', 'However, critics of higher taxation note that the Walz administration oversaw an increase in some personal income taxes and elimination of some deductions for high earners, as well as an expanded scope of the corporate income tax to capture some international business income.', '“While other states have cut taxes and their regulatory burdens, Minnesota has chosen to double down on adding more burdens and more taxes to Minnesotans, and that makes Minnesota a less affordable place to live and build a business,” said Doug Loon, president and chief executive officer of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. “As we continue to layer on new taxes and fees on not just businesses, but the consuming public, our costs go up — and that puts us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other states.”', 'The Mighty Mississippi birthed a rich industry base in Minnesota — starting with sawmills and flour mills — that since has exploded into a heavily diverse economy that has helped the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and the state as a whole weather challenging times, Loon said.', 'The diverse economy “has been one of our strengths going back a century,” Loon said. “We have an innovative, hard-working population that’s highly skilled at the same time. It’s really the secret sauce of our success, and it’s one of the reasons that Minnesota has been an attractant, historically, of highly educated and skilled workers from around the globe and the country.”', 'Minnesota ranks third in the nation for number of Fortune 500 companies per capita, with United Health, General Mills, Target, Best Buy, 3M, CHS and Land O’ Lakes on that list.', 'Health care is the biggest industry in the state, which is also home to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Advanced manufacturing, agriculture, retail, education and clean energy closely follow.', '“We’re not seeing headquarters and offices move out of [Minnesota] the way we have seen [elsewhere],” said Adam Kamins, senior director and regional economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Taxes are higher in Minnesota than they are in some other places, but one thing I think offets that is you have a really healthy dynamic for these firms.”', 'The state’s labor market took longer than most to recover the jobs shed at the outset of the pandemic, he said.', '“Minneapolis and St. Paul, like a lot of other big cities, were hit hard by the switch to remote work and the increased flexibility that people have,” he said, referencing some of the migration losses.', 'Still, the inherent demand within Minnesota’s labor market was on full display during the economic recovery as its unemployment rate was among the lowest in the country — and at one point, fell to the lowest ever recorded for a US state. The cost of living fared better as well, with the Minneapolis metro area showing a steeper slowdown in inflation than others.', '“We need to make sure that we have a growing population to meet the needs of the economy,” Loon said.', 'A key part of that future economy will be Minneapolis, Kamins noted.', '“Minneapolis has not done as well as it did historically,” Kamins said. “Growth has been a little bit better in some smaller metro areas, some rural parts of the state. And we’ve seen a lot of growth actually driven by Rochester and by the Mayo Clinic in particular. That’s been the single most important driver of growth in the state over the last five to 10 years, and probably an even longer period than that.”', 'The protest and civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020 “certainly put Minneapolis on the map in a way that it did not want to be,” Kamins said.', '“Maybe there’s a marginal impact, reputationally, in terms of attracting movers or driving people to leave and look more at the suburbs,” Kamins said. “But I think it was very marginal, and it’s fairly temporary.”', 'The rebuilding and surge of economic investment continues to this day with Minneapolis’ Lake Street and the area around George Floyd Square continuing to show a transformation.', 'More broadly, Minneapolis also has focused heavily in affordable housing, including making land use changes to encourage an increase in residential supply and investing in a program to help close racial wealth gaps and spur homeownership for Black families.', 'Walz’s first term was colored by the pandemic, the aftermath of Floyd’s death and a divided government. When he took office for a second term, however, he declared “the era of gridlock” had come to an end.', 'With the Democratic Party in control of both state houses, the Walz administration was able to leverage a $17 billion state surplus and ferry through a heavily progressive agenda that included free college tuition for lower-earning families, free school breakfasts and lunches for every kid, a child tax credit, protection for abortion access, support for gender-affirming care, investments in affordable housing and a paid family and medical leave law.', 'The Harris-Walz campaign hailed those and other policies in a statement provided to CNN.', '“Gov. Walz led Minnesota back with strong leadership, competent management, and smart policies — cutting taxes for working families and reaching the lowest state unemployment rate in recorded history,” according to the statement. “That’s why CNBC ranked Minnesota the best state in the country for business outside of the South.”', 'The vast majority of the laws and programs passed during Walz’s second term are either too nascent to have a measurable economic impact just yet or are not yet operational (the paid leave program launches in 2026, for example), economists told CNN.', 'However, they help set the stage for the future, said Matt Varilek, commissioner at the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development', '“A priority of the administration is a more inclusive economy both on the workforce side and trying to open doors for folks who have been historically overlooked,” Varilek said. “A lot more work needs to be done, and we’re proud to have made progress.”']","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/tim-walz-harris-vice-president/index.html', 'https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossyoder/tim-walz-viral-hotdish-casserole-recipe', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUP5pilmD_4', 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/27/economy/inflation-2023-impacts-americans/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/economy/fourth-quarter-gdp/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/economy/fourth-quarter-gdp/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/02/us/somali-minnesota-photos/', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/13/tech/silicon-valley-moving-to-austin-miami/index.html', 'https://taxfoundation.org/blog/tim-walz-tax-policies/', 'https://www.mnhs.org/millcity/learn/history', 'https://mn.gov/deed/joinusmn/why-mn/rankings/', 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/economy/florida-inflation-hotspot-regional/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/us/george-floyd-protests-different-why/index.html', 'https://www.visitlakestreet.com/redevelopment', 'https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2024/twin-cities-region-meets-ambitious-housing-goals-for-second-year-but-has-much-work-left-to-do', 'https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/12/06/an-incredibly-strong-place-huge-budget-surplus-expected']","Published

Economists and analysts say the revisions will likely put further pressure on the central bank to loosen its monetary policy.', '“This may be the wake-up call for Powell and [Fed policymakers] that they need to commit to cuts and forward guidance more explicitly,” Michael Block, co-founder and chief strategy officer at AgentSmyth, told CNN.', 'Wednesday’s preliminary downward revision was expected, economists say, noting the lagged but far more accurate Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, or QCEW, has shown a slower pace of job gains than the more timely, but less comprehensive, monthly employment surveys and estimates (*more on that methodology and the revision process later).', 'However, the size of the preliminary revision was a little surprising, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. He attributed that to how the BLS tries to capture new business formation and the closure of establishments (known as the birth-death model).', 'The pandemic had a seismic impact on the US economy and the labor market, and its aftershocks still linger to this day. New business applications surged, but with births come deaths, and the BLS’ model has been overstating the new business formation and understating deaths, Sweet told CNN.', 'To that end, “this is really just a counting issue” and a measurement issue versus a red flag about the health of the labor market, Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, told CNN.', '“160 million people have a job,” Slok said. ”Telling me that over the last 12 months it wasn’t 160 million, it was only 159.2 million is not making too much of a difference to how the Fed and financial markets are thinking about the economy.”', 'Other economists cautioned that Wednesday’s numbers are still preliminary (the final benchmark revisions will be released alongside the January jobs report in February 2025), and that while the QCEW does pick up some of the impact from the recent surge in immigration, it might not fully reflect undocumented workers.', 'While this rearview look suggests that job growth was softening a bit sooner than previously thought, the labor market was solid then, Sweet said. And it still has some good fundamentals going for it now, he added, noting that the unemployment rate increased because more people were looking for work (versus higher layoffs) and employment-to-population ratios remain high.', '“I think the key is really going to be August employment,” Sweet said, noting the upcoming jobs report due out in a couple weeks.', 'Economic data is revised often — especially as more comprehensive information becomes available — to provide a clearer, more accurate, picture of the dynamics at play.', 'One of the most illustrative examples of this is the BLS’ labor market data and, specifically, the all-important jobs report.', 'The BLS’ monthly snapshot of the labor market is comprised of two surveys: One of households (which provides demographic data and feeds into the all-important unemployment rate) and the other of businesses (designed to measure employment, hours and earnings).', 'The latter establishment survey is responsible for the monthly estimates of how many jobs were added or lost.', 'It’s important to note the “estimates” part of this: It is a survey after all, albeit a fairly robust one (the BLS surveys well north of 100,000 businesses and government agencies, representing roughly 629,000 individual worksites).', 'When the market-moving jobs report is released, that initial estimate is often based on incomplete data and thus will be revised twice further in the two jobs reports that follow as the BLS receives more information.', 'In addition to the surveying, the BLS also incorporates methodology to try to capture employment activity at new businesses and those that have closed.', 'Even then, the monthly numbers aren’t final and fully comprehensive.', 'That’s where the annual benchmark revisions come in. And the first part of that process is what happened Wednesday.', 'Every year, the BLS conducts annual benchmark revisions to replace these sample-based employment estimates with fuller employment counts as recorded in the QCEW.', 'The QCEW provides a more comprehensive read on the number of businesses, employees and wages at the state, regional and county level because it derives that data from quarterly tax reports submitted by businesses to their states.', 'Given that process, the QCEW comes at a substantial lag: The data for the first quarter of 2024 was also released Wednesday and showed that in March 2024, national employment increased to 153.6 million, a 1.3% increase during the past year.']","['https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/23/economy/us-jobs-data-annual-revisions/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/economy/january-jobs-report-final/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/economy/us-jobs-report-july-final/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/investing/stocks-are-rallying-again-are-they-out-of-the-woods/index.html', 'https://www.bls.gov/cew/', 'https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm', 'https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.htm', 'https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesprelbmk.htm']","Updated

But she is winning over some key figures on Wall Street.', 'Since the whirlwind launch of her presidential campaign after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, Harris has won the support of some prominent Wall Street figures.', 'At times, big business clashed with Biden, whose progressive administration fought mergers and routinely blamed corporate greed for the inflation crisis. So Wall Street’s embrace of Harris, who supported Biden’s policies, was no guarantee.', '“Harris has a better relationship with Wall Street than even Joe Biden had,” Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN in a phone interview on Tuesday.', 'Harris’ stances on Corporate America and Wall Street are a bit more of a blank slate than Biden. But as a California attorney general and senator, she had a generally more open approach than Biden had with Silicon Valley, where America’s biggest companies reside. And so far, Wall Street titans are opening their checkbooks, bringing her a sizeable pool of money from a part of the economy that in the past has favored Republican candidates.', 'At the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, former American Express CEO Ken Chenault strongly endorsed Harris, particularly contrasting her with Donald Trump.', '“She knows that a market-based economy needs a strong and effective government. Kamala Harris understands that we need help to turn good ideas into thriving companies, that we can create good-paying jobs by helping manufacturers expand,” he said. “Unlike her opponent, she knows the way not to build an advanced economy is a broad tariff that would only raise prices, hurt consumers and businesses and cost jobs.”', 'But even before Harris revealed key details of her platform, Roger Altman, founder and senior chairman of Evercore, told CNBC last month that he supports Harris and that expects her campaign to be “very well financed.”', 'Blackstone president Jonathan Gray contributed $413,000 to the Harris Action Fund at the end of July, a source familiar with his giving told CNN.', 'Alex Soros, son of billionaire liberal donor George Soros, endorsed Harris in an X post last month. George Soros also supports Harris, his spokesperson told CNN. Avenue Capital Group CEO Marc Lasry donated $100K to the Harris Action Fund in March, according to Federal Election Commission data.', 'Sonnenfeld, known as the “CEO Whisperer,” argued that Harris’ stronger relationship with Wall Street compared to Biden’s is because she toned down the “class warfare” rhetoric and had a track record as California attorney general acting fairly — even if not overly favorably — with businesses.', '“She went after abuses but didn’t see the scale of enterprise itself as misconduct. She knows that thriving businesses are good for the economy and the average American worker,” Sonnenfeld said.', 'Of course, some Wall Street bigwigs have made their support for Trump clear. Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management, endorsed Trump as president in a July X post. Blackstone CEO Stephen\xa0Schwarzman said in March that he is backing the former president’s bid. Key Square Group founder Scott Bessent is a supporter of Trump and attended his rally in Asheville, North Carolina.', 'Burns McKinney, managing director at NFJ Investment Group, says that some big investors might favor Trump’s promises of tax cuts and tariffs over Harris’ populist economic policies, since they could spur growth.', 'But such tax cuts could lead to higher deficits, and US corporations would likely pass along those tariff costs to consumers by raising prices, he said — both factors that could push up inflation, an issue that until recently was top of mind for Wall Street.', 'The Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively more than two years ago from near-zero levels during the Covid pandemic. Annual inflation was running at 9% at its peak in June 2022. Last month it fell below 3%, raising hopes among traders that the central bank could manage to bring inflation to target without triggering a recession.', 'Harris’ policies could also be inflationary. Her proposed policies center around making big-ticket expenses from housing to groceries to childcare more affordable, largely through offering tax relief for the middle-class and lower-income Americans and challenging price gouging. While giving Americans more money to spend should be good news for consumers, that could also push up demand for goods and services and, in turn, prices.', 'Harris’ campaign said Monday that she will fight to hike the corporate tax rate to 28% from the current 21%, a reversal of Trump’s tax cuts, which lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35%, to help pay for her campaign promises. Some investors have criticized the proposed tax rate hike, arguing that it could weigh on US companies and crimp the economy.', 'Of course, Trump has vowed to impose massive new tariffs on China and all trading partners, moves that could provoke a destabilizing global trade war. That would create massive uncertainty, something investors famously despise.', 'Beyond trade policy, investors are bracing for a potential shift in governance style if Trump is returned to the White House. In particular, Sonnenfeld pointed to Trump’s history of attacking iconic American companies such as Harley-Davidson, Delta and Nike.', '“Wall Street hates Trump’s mercurial vindictiveness. Trump’s temperment creates havoc in financial markets,” Sonnenfeld said.', 'Some institutional investors also say that a key issue for Wall Street when deciding who to back could be the candidates’ differing attitudes toward the Fed’s longstanding independence.', 'Led by Chair Jerome Powell, the Fed functions as its own government institution and is overseen by Congress. Trump, who tried to pressure the Fed to lower rates during his presidency, has said that he believes the president should be able to directly influence monetary policy. On Monday, he attempted to soften his previous comments. Harris has vowed to keep her input out of the Fed’s decisions.', 'The Fed’s autonomy is meant to prevent political agendas from swaying monetary policy. Some investors worry the central bank could lose its credibility, one of its most important tools for fulfilling its dual-mandate of price stability and maximum employment, if the US president were to have explicit influence over its actions.', '“That would be really problematic,” said Gerald Goldberg, chief executive of GYL Financial Synergies.', 'Harris’ relationship with Wall Street titans has been tense at times, most notably when she was the California attorney general and took on big banks in the aftermath of the housing crisis.', 'Harris pulled California out of discussions in 2011 with other state attorneys general to show that the still-forming deal needed to be tougher on banks. Her actions helped secure a roughly $20 billion settlement for Californians.', 'Harris has formed relationships with businesspeople, including Lazard President Ray McGuire and Centerview Partners co-founder Blair Effron, and is expected to lean on her connections for advice, according to people familiar with the matter. Harris in July joined a conversation with supporters hosted by JPMorgan vice chairman Peter Scher at his home, a company spokesperson told CNN.', 'A source previously told CNN that Harris hosted JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for lunch at the White House in recent months.

How prepared individuals are for retirement is tied to a person’s savings opportunities and risks, which can vary widely and are highly dependent on their employers.', 'The Morningstar analysis set out to identify more specifically who is likely to face the smallest risk of running short of money in retirement and why — and those who face the greatest risk.', 'Having access to — and participating in — a 401(k) or similar employer-provided savings plan for two decades or more will give you one of the best chances of having enough in savings and Social Security benefits to cover your living and health expenses when you retire.', 'Only 21% of households who do this will run the risk of falling short financially, Morningstar projects.', 'But here’s the problem: Nearly half (47%) of US workers do not have access to such a plan, Morningstar estimates. And among the workers who do have access, approximately 16% do not participate.', '“There is a retirement crisis … for those who do not [have] or are unable to participate in a defined-contribution plan,” the researchers wrote.', 'They project more than half of workers (57%) who don’t participate in a workplace plan could see shortfalls in retirement.', 'If you work in the private sector, your employer has to decide whether to offer a retirement savings plan. Large companies typically do, but smaller employers are less likely to. And if you work for a business as an independent contractor or temporary worker, you likely wouldn’t be allowed to participate in any plan.', 'By contrast, public-sector employees are among the workers who run the lowest risk of running short on income in retirement, Morningstar found.', 'That’s because they are most likely to have a defined-benefit pension — and they also have a high likelihood of having access to a 401k-like defined-contribution plan, said Spencer Look, associate director of retirement studies at Morningstar and a coauthor of the analysis.', '“In many cases, [public sector] workers have a DB pension and an opportunity to contribute to a DC plan,” Look said.', 'Morningstar’s shortfall projections are oriented toward those with two or more decades to save in the years ahead, which is time that the oldest Gen Xers and youngest Baby Boomers don’t have.', 'For that cohort, however, the same general principles apply, Look said. “If they have consistently saved and avoided undermining their retirement by, for example, taking pre-retirement withdrawals or cashing out upon job termination, their prospects in retirement are better because they have larger balances, all else equal.”', 'And for the youngest Gen Xers, born between 1975 and 1980, who haven’t been saving at all or not consistently, there is still time to course-correct.', 'But that will depend on their access to a tax-advantaged plan and their income. Morningstar estimates that 48% of Gen Xers don’t have access to a DC plan and roughly 79% don’t have access to a defined benefit pension.', 'What’s more, a study done last year by the National Institute on Retirement Security found that income is the single biggest factor in determining who has built savings and who has not. “Retirement savings for Generation X is highly concentrated among the highest earners,” the report noted.', 'The somewhat better news is that of the Gen Xers who do have access to a 401(k) or similar plan, only 7% elect not to participate, Look noted.', 'Labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci, author of “Work, Retire, Repeat: The Uncertainty of Retirement in the New Economy,” has long argued that the individual-directed US retirement system has failed those people who put in decades of work and yet can’t afford to save enough along the way.', 'Policymakers have implemented some changes designed to make it easier for people to save, through new laws like Secure 2.0. Indeed, Morningstar notes that one reason why Millennials and Gen Z workers might have a lower risk of falling short in retirement than Gen Xers and Baby Boomers is because of recent features added to 401(k)s like automatic enrollment and target-date funds.', 'And more changes may come in the years ahead. A bipartisan bill called the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, which is based on a paper written by Ghilarducci and former top Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett, has supporters in both the House and the Senate, and may be reintroduced for consideration when the next Congress convenes in January 2025. That bill would create a portable, tax-advantaged retirement savings program for tens of millions of low- and middle-income workers that would offer a matching contribution from the federal government.', '“Over half of working employees lack access to the tax-advantaged retirement benefits that many higher-income earners take advantage of to save. Additionally, as the workforce continues to innovate and more Americans become categorized as ‘gig workers,’ the reliance on traditional employer-sponsored plans causes too many workers to slip through the cracks,” said Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Lloyd Smucker, a co-sponsor of the bill, when it was reintroduced in October 2023.', 'But even if that bill becomes law eventually, it isn’t likely to offer much help to anyone who is within a decade of retirement today. For them, trying to work longer, save as much as they can while they are still collecting a paycheck and cutting back on expenses may be their best shot at trying to stay solvent in retirement.']","['https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/07/success/pensions-retirement-savings-explained/index.html', 'https://www.morningstar.com/content/cs-assets/v3/assets/blt9415ea4cc4157833/bltd4bb265[…]tar_Model_of_US_Retirement_Outcomes_-_July_2024_-_final.pdf', 'https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/success/retirement-savings-secure-2-0-omnibus/index.html', 'https://smucker.house.gov/media/press-releases/smucker-sewell-hickenlooper-tillis-reintroduce-bill-help-americans-save']","Published

But to take on any major role in that administration, Musk would have a mountain of conflicts of interest to climb.', 'By law (and by common sense), you can’t work on government matters that would affect your own personal finances. That’s a big problem for someone like Musk, whose $245 billion fortune is largely tied up in shares of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), along with his holdings in the fields of biotech, artificial intelligence, satellite communications and road infrastructure projects.', 'Typically, people entering public office remedy that problem by divesting their stocks and other holdings or by putting them in a blind trust. But Musk, the CEO and single largest shareholder of Tesla, can’t just sell his stake without causing the price to collapse. And given the scope of his business interests, it’s hard to see where he could serve without having to recuse himself regularly.', '“Much would depend on what the job is and how it relates to his economic interest,” said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School. “Is there anything that wouldn’t relate to his economic interests? I’m not sure what that would be.”', 'Still, the MAGA odd couple of Musk and Trump is clearly having fun teasing at the idea of a Secretary Musk. On Monday, Trump told Reuters that he would consider naming Musk to an advisory or Cabinet role if reelected in November.', '“He’s a very smart guy. I certainly would, if he would do it, I certainly would. He’s a brilliant guy,” Trump said.', 'Musk didn’t respond directly to that comment, but he posted on X that he is “willing to serve.” That statement was posted in Muskian fashion, over a doctored image of himself standing at a lectern labeled “D.O.G.E. Department of Government Efficiency,” a reference to the crypto meme token. So make of that what you will.', 'Musk, who rarely speaks directly to the press, didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. The Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.', 'The chatter about Musk taking a DC gig intensified last month after he publicly endorsed Trump, and again after the two alluded to the possibility during a glitchy, rambling interview on X last week.', 'There are many reasons to take all of this speculation with a grain of salt. Not least: They both tend to lie and exaggerate to keep their names in the headlines.', 'But just as a thought experiment, let’s say they were serious and that Musk would actually want to serve in public office.', '“The biggest\xa0hurdle for Musk would be to obtain Senate approval, as all Cabinet\xa0officers must do,” said Alan Morrison, a professor at George Washington University Law School.\xa0“Depending\xa0on the position, the Senate might well insist that he divest himself of specific securities” — including but not limited to Tesla,\xa0if he went to the Transportation Department, or SpaceX\xa0if he went to the Defense Department.', 'He wouldn’t be the first executive to go through that process.', 'Before becoming George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2006, former Goldman Sachs president Henry Paulson sold more than 3 million shares of the bank, valued at nearly $500 million, and vowed to recuse himself from any substantive issues relating to the institution or its executives without an explicit waiver from the government. (That got pretty hard to do when the financial system nearly collapsed two years later, of course.)', 'Beyond the legal and ethical quagmire Musk would face in DC, the bigger opposition might come from Wall Street.', 'Musk may be the wealthiest person on the planet, but if there’s one thing he can’t afford, it’s another job title.', 'Tesla shareholders are already rather annoyed by the CEO’s extracurricular activities, especially all the time he spends tweeting memes and conspiracy theories on X, the platform he spent $44 billion on two years ago and which is now worth less than half of that (by Musk’s own estimation).', '“Musk potentially being offered a Cabinet position in a Trump White House would be a disaster scenario Tesla investors would not want to see,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. “Musk needs to be focused on Tesla … The last thing the Street wants to see is Elon side by side with Trump in the Oval Office.”', 'Asked about how likely such he thinks such a scenario would be, Ives said the idea “feels far-fetched. But it’s Trump and Musk, so anything is possible.”']","['https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/', 'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-would-consider-ending-7500-electric-vehicle-credit-2024-08-19/', 'https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1825723913051000851?s=12&t=rgCph0dGAlCYvNRKXWzAyA', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/politics/fact-check-trump-musk-20-false-claims/index.html', 'https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paulson-files-to-sell-500-mln-in-goldman-stock']","Published

It came about when he realized there were no local platforms to share ideas and advocate for artists.', '“We started to bring together every creative person we knew: artists, musicians, designers, architects,” he told CNN. “The community started to expand and then we started to understand that the potential of creative people in Uzbekistan is very huge.”', '“When there is no industry, it is very hard to work in this sphere.

It’s her rallying cry to women in Central Asia to engage in sports and continue doing what they love after marriage.', 'She feels that social media can offer young people opportunities for self-expression. “School forces you to do something, but on the internet, you can learn or create something for yourself,” she says. “I think that’s why the youth are captivated by all this. They see a future in it.”', 'In Tashkent, Human House Gallery has been a hub for local artists for over 20 years. Founder and director Lola Saifi says a lot has changed in the country over the past five years.', '“It has become much easier to do business in Uzbekistan,” Saifi says. “Many areas now see growth and a reduction in bureaucracy, which is very important. As for the creative economy, unfortunately, I think we are still at the beginning, and the state does not yet see the difference between the creative and non-creative economies.”', 'Local artists say that despite official backing for landmark projects, financial support on a grassroots level is difficult to access, even though the sector can be a valuable contributor to the economy.', '“It’s the same entrepreneurship, the same business as all the others.

And men (54%) were more likely to report having political conversations on the job than women (35%).', 'But not everyone reported feeling comfortable with those discussions. Fourteen percent said such conversations helped them feel included, and 11% said the political exchanges even made them feel closer to their coworker. But 12% reported feeling uncomfortable, and 3% said they felt they were treated unfairly for their views.', 'Engaged workers were much less likely than disengaged workers to say they felt uncomfortable. “This suggests employee engagement may have a buffering effect on political discussions, increasing the chance that employees give trusted coworkers the benefit of the doubt during political discussions, even if they disagree. Likewise, they may feel safe expressing contrary opinions of their own,” Gallup said in a write-up of its findings.', 'While the survey doesn’t report on the comfort levels expressed by the 38% of respondents who said they have been in earshot of such exchanges, Gallup suggested it may have been mixed, citing research published earlier this year in the\xa0Journal of Applied Psychology.', '“(That research)\xa0found that the costs of hearing political conversations could include impeded goal progress and lower job satisfaction for employees who perceive themselves as having dissimilar perspectives, while the benefits could include a more positive mindset from overhearing conversations they agree with,” they wrote.', 'Given how fervently people feel about so, so many things this election season, workplace experts advise leaders and employees to tread cautiously so that any discussions about lightning rod issues don’t derail employees’ ability to work well together.', 'That includes leaders making clear the boundaries for exchanges, said Christy\xa0Pruitt-Haynes, global head of the talent practice at the NeuroLeadership Institute.

When consumers have moved on to some other fad flower and you’re left with a glut of tulips, prices go down. Anyone who’s ever hailed an Uber after a Taylor Swift show or booked a flight for the week of Thanksgiving has reasonably expected to pay more than they would off-peak.', 'But these days, companies are harnessing huge amounts of data to fine-tune their pricing power in places customers might not expect. And people are, understandably, kinda pissed about it.', 'Earlier this month, US lawmakers raised the alarm over dynamic pricing in grocery stores via electronic shelf labels that allow stores to adjust prices instantly. While that can save employees a bunch of time, it also opens the door for stores to “calibrate price increases to extract maximum profits” at a time when grocery prices are already straining household budgets.', 'In a letter to Kroger, the largest US grocery chain by revenue, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey argued that widespread adoption of digital price tags “appears poised to enable large grocery stores to squeeze consumers to increase profits.”', 'It’s not just good old-fashioned price-gouging, either, they allege. Kroger is partnering with Microsoft on a plan to stick cameras on its digital displays, which will used facial recognition tools to “exploit sensitive customer data” and craft personalized offers. (Creepy!)', 'A Kroger spokesperson pushed back on those claims, arguing that the store’s business model “is to lower prices over time so that more customers shop with us, which leads to more revenue that we then invest in lower prices, higher wages, and an even better shopping experience … Any test of electronic shelf tags is to lower prices more for customers where it matters most. To suggest otherwise is not true.”', 'So is dynamic pricing just a nicer way of saying price-gouging, or are companies actually trying to get their customers a better deal?', 'Yes. And also, yes.', 'Look, business is business, and corporations are going to embrace whatever technology they can to make money. But extracting a short-term profit with creepy AI that knows your specific, individual buying history — like the kind Starbucks used recently on my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald — isn’t worth it if they anger their customer base.', 'Back in 1999, the CEO of Coca-Cola merely floated the idea of a dynamic pricing model and it became a debacle almost as dumb as New Coke.', 'The idea was, maybe we put thermometers on vending machines that would automatically raise the price for a Coke on a hot day. The anger was instant. People accused Coke of price-gouging, and Pepsi accused its rival of exploiting consumers, according to the New York Times.', 'Coke immediately walked it back, saying that the company was actually talking about ways thermometer technology could lower the cost of a drink.', 'Which sounds pretty familiar…', 'This spring, when Wendy’s announced plans to use AI-powered digital menus with variable pricing based on the time of day, fans immediately accused it of pricing-gouging. No, no, Wendy’s said — we weren’t going to raise prices at peak times, we were going to lower prices at off-peak times.', 'And there’s the rub. Companies will swear up and down their “dynamic” pricing only goes one way — down.', 'But, historically, we know better, because we’ve seen how big corporations nickel and dime us to pad their margins when given the chance. We’ve bought plane tickets and paid for checked bags and watched our favorite singer’s ticket price go from $50 to $85 because of some unidentifiable “service” and “handling” fees. Countless girls and women have paid a “pink tax” on skin care and hair care products, and stores regularly tout sales promotions that ultimately benefit their bottom line more than the customer.', 'That’s why Marco Bertini, a professor of marketing at Esade Business School in Barcelona, says the problem is not the tools used for dynamic pricing but the monopolistic status of the companies potentially abusing them.

19,All eyes on Powell’s Jackson Hole speech as new data fuels concern of a weaker labor market,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/22/economy/jackson-hole-powell/index.html,"['What do a mountainside resort and economists have in common? Next to nothing, if it weren’t for an annual invite-only summit the Kansas City Federal Reserve hosts at the Jackson Lake Lodge nestled in a valley by the Teton mountains just outside Jackson Hole, Wyoming.', 'And it’s that time of year again. For the next three days, top economists from across the globe will rub shoulders with one another and mingle with reporters and investors hungry for clues about the economic outlook. But you won’t need an invite to hear what’s undoubtedly going to be the talk of the valley: Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s keynote address that’s set to take place Friday at 10 am ET.', 'His speech comes at a pivotal time not just for the US economy but for Fed officials as well.', 'Last month, the US unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 4.3%, its highest level since October 2021. Employers, meanwhile, hired just 114,000 new workers in July, the second-lowest monthly gain since December 2020. The disappointing data sparked some fears that the economy could soon enter a recession — or, even worse, already be in one.', 'That has subjected the Fed to a considerable amount of criticism for its decision not to cut interest rates at its last meeting, which took place just two days before the July jobs report came out. Now, with a cooling labor market and inflation trailing just a hair above the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank is widely expected to cut rates in September. But some economists are concerned that central bankers waited too long, and that the delay could be exacerbating the weakening of the labor market.', 'New data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Wednesday did little to quell those concerns. Though not finalized yet, the agency’s annual review of employment data suggests there were 818,000 fewer jobs in March of this year than were initially reported.', 'Because of that, a growing share of investors now believe the Fed could opt for a half-point cut next month rather than the more typical quarter-point cut, according to Fed funds futures data. Additionally, the data has raised the odds that the Fed will lower rates more than once this year.', 'Where does Powell stand in this discourse? We could find out on Friday.', 'Last year, investors interpreted Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks as a sign that the Fed was done hiking rates, despite Powell saying it could still happen. Markets rallied, with the Dow adding 241 points, or 0.7%. Their interpretation ended up being correct — the Fed hasn’t raised rates since last July.', 'Powell’s 2022 keynote Jackson Hole address got the exact opposite reaction. It set in motion that officials were going to be unapologetic in their fight against inflation, even if it meant inflicting “pain,” as Powell said, on households and businesses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all closed at least 3% lower that day.', 'Two three-quarter-point rate hikes followed at the Fed’s subsequent meetings after Jackson Hole that year.', 'Powell isn’t the only US central banker who has used Jackson Hole as an opportunity to preview monetary policy changes.', 'For instance, in 2010, then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke signaled that the central bank was likely to ease financial conditions further as the economy recovered from the Great Recession, saying that “policy options are available to provide additional stimulus.” Months after Bernanke’s Jackson Hole speech, he unveiled a whole new phase of bond purchasing in an effort to bring interest rates down to juice the economy after the financial crisis. That action has now become known as QE2, short for quantitative easing.', 'Then, in his 2012 Jackson Hole address, Bernanke said that labor market stagnation was a “grave concern.” Markets initially dropped after Bernanke’s remarks, but ended the day higher. Shortly after the Jackson Hole meeting, the Fed launched QE3.', 'In 2016, then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen, the current Treasury secretary, used her Jackson Hole address to prepare markets for more rate hikes, saying that she believed “the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months.” Starting in December 2016, the Fed hiked rates approximately every three meetings until 2018.', 'Economists expect Powell’s address to strike a dovish tone: That is, when central bankers favor efforts like lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy to counteract weakness, instead of focusing on getting inflation lower.', 'The question is just how dovish Powell will get.', 'The mere mention of Wednesday’s substantial downward payroll data revisions would signal that a half-point cut could be on the table at September’s meeting, Citigroup economists said in a note Wednesday. Economists from the bank are forecasting half-point cuts at both the September and November meeting.', 'Goldman Sachs economists expect Powell to express “a bit more confidence in the inflation outlook” and possibly say that officials are paying close attention to labor market data while noting the Fed is “well positioned to support the economy if necessary.”', 'Comments like those would solidify a cut in September but would still leave open the question of the rate cut size until the August jobs report, due September 6, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note earlier this week.', 'While they aren’t expecting Powell to say anything that implies the current rate level“is inappropriate in light of the progress made on inflation,” if he did, that would raise the odds of a larger September cut and fuel the case for more cuts at future meetings.', 'Powell, though, won’t be the only Fed official at Jackson Hole. Plenty of other key figures from the central bank, including Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic, will be in attendance, partaking in impromptu media interviews, which could provide more color on the economic outlook than Powell.']","['https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/economy/us-jobs-report-july-final/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/economy/july-fed-meeting-preview/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/economy/bls-jobs-revisions/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/markets-jackson-hole-fed-meeting/index.html']","Published

US farmers might find shortages of fertilizer and US water treatment plants near the Canadian border could run of out chlorine they use to purify water.', 'This is the first time that both major Canadian railroads have shut down at the same time due to a labor dispute. The most recent work stoppage in the industry was a 60-hour strike at Canadian Pacific in 2022. Before that, there was a nine-day strike at Canadian National in 2019.', 'Thursday’s action is different from a strike, in which union members refuse to report for work.

But the agreement was immediately met with fierce criticism from journalist unions, who called the deal “disastrous.”', 'The plan calls for a $250 million commitment over five years from Google and the state, a majority of which would fund California newsrooms, and launch an artificial intelligence “accelerator” designed to support journalists’ work.', 'The deal ends a high-profile bill, dubbed the California Journalism Preservation Act by state assemblymember Buffy Wicks, that would have forced technology companies, including Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META), to pay news companies to distribute their content online. The bill, which was modeled after similar laws implemented in Australia and Canada, would have funded local news organizations that have seen their business models collapse amid the rise of big tech platforms.', '“As technology and innovation advance, it is critical that California continues to champion the vital role of journalism in our democracy,” Wicks said in a statement announcing the deal with Google. “This partnership represents a cross-sector commitment to supporting a free and vibrant press, empowering local news outlets up and down the state to continue in their essential work. This is just the beginning. I remain committed to finding even more ways to support journalism in our state for years to come.”', 'California Gov.

But it was sharply criticized by unions representing the state’s journalists, which had supported Wicks’ bill to fund newsrooms but were not involved with the deal.', '“The future of journalism should not be decided in backroom deals,” the Media Guild of the West, The NewsGuild-CWA and others said in a joint statement. “The Legislature embarked on an effort to regulate monopolies and failed terribly. Now we question whether the state has done more harm than good. California’s journalists and news workers OPPOSE this disastrous deal with Google and condemn the news executives who consented to it in our names.”', 'The deal also faced blowback from other Democrats in the California legislature, including state Sen. Steve Glazer, who had proposed a bill of his own to provide tax credits to news outlets employing full-time journalists.', '“Despite the good intentions of the parties involved, this proposal does not provide sufficient resources to bring independent news gathering in California out of its death spiral,” Glazer said Wednesday during a press conference. “Google’s offer is completely inadequate and massively short of matching their settlement agreement in Canada in supporting on-the-ground local news reporting.”', 'California State Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire also criticized the deal, saying in a statement, “Newsrooms have been hollowed out across this state while tech platforms have seen multi-billion dollar profits. We have concerns that this proposal lacks sufficient funding for newspapers and local media, and doesn’t fully address the inequities facing the industry.”', 'The deal comes months after Google elected to block news content in California over the proposed law from Wicks, drawing swift backlash from news outlets in the state.', 'The News/Media Alliance, which represents US newspapers and online publications, said it had sent letters to the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General to request an investigation into whether Google broke any laws by limiting access to the news outlets.', 'Google previously threatened to take similar action in Canada ahead of the country’s new law requiring digital platforms to compensate news publishers for their work, but eventually backed down. Under Canada’s Online News Act, Google will pay $74 million per year into a fund that will be distributed to publishers.', '“Google is the biggest source of referral traffic on the internet. When you are doing journalism on the internet, you have to do business with Google,” Media Guild of the West President Matt Pearce said after Wednesday’s announcement. “The premise of these bills is that if we are going to be dominated by a monopolist whose product we cannot escape, except at enormous cost to our own business, that monopoly needs to pay its fair share for our journalism.”']","['https://www.cnn.com/markets/stocks/GOOGL', 'https://www.mediaguildwest.org/news/californias-journalists-do-not-consent-to-this-shakedown', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/media/news-publishers-group-urges-government-investigate-google/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/tech/google-deal-with-canada-news-content/index.html']","Updated
